#### Google ADK, LLM, RAG, and MCP Server Interaction

This explains the interaction between Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK), Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. These components work together to process user queries and generate accurate, contextually relevant responses in a multi-agent system.

#### Overview

The system enables intelligent query processing by combining ADK’s agent orchestration, RAG’s data retrieval, MCP’s tool access, and LLMs’ reasoning capabilities. A user query (e.g., “How to build an AI?”) is handled through a structured workflow, resulting in a comprehensive response augmented with external data and tool outputs. The interaction is visualized in a flowchart generated by the gen_d.py script (see Diagram).

#### Components

Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)

Description: An open-source Python framework for building multi-agent systems. ADK orchestrates agents and tools to process queries and manage workflows.

#### Key Features:

- LlmAgent: A coordinator powered by an LLM, interpreting queries and delegating tasks.
- SequentialAgent: Executes tasks in a predefined order (e.g., retrieve data, then generate response).
- Tools: Integrates RAG for data retrieval and MCP clients for external services.

Role: Acts as the central orchestrator, managing query processing, tool invocation, and session state.

#### Large Language Model (LLM)

Description: A generative AI model (e.g., Gemini 2.0, Gemma 3, or local models via Ollama) that reasons and produces natural language responses.

Key Features:

- Processes augmented prompts containing user queries, RAG data, and MCP tool outputs.
- Generates coherent, contextually relevant answers.

Role: Provides reasoning and response generation, leveraging external data for accuracy.

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Description: A system that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant data from a knowledge base.

Key Features:

- Vector Store: Stores document embeddings for fast retrieval.
- Knowledge Base: Contains proprietary or external data (e.g., enterprise documents, web pages).
- Semantic Search: Matches queries to relevant data using vector similarity.

Role: Retrieves up-to-date or domain-specific data to augment LLM prompts.

#### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

Description: A server that standardizes access to external tools or services (e.g., YouTube Search, database queries).

Key Features:

- Tools: Functions like youtube_search or database_query, exposed via MCP’s client-server architecture.
- MCP Client: ADK agents connect to MCP servers to discover and invoke tools.

Role: Provides ADK agents with access to external data or actions, extending system capabilities.

#### Interaction Flow

The components interact in a structured pipeline to process a user query:

User Query:

A user submits a query (e.g., “How to build an AI?”) via a front-end interface (e.g., web app, chatbot).

ADK Orchestration:

The ADK’s LlmAgent interprets the query and decides whether to invoke RAG, MCP tools, or both.
A SequentialAgent may manage the workflow, ensuring tasks are executed in order.

#### RAG Data Retrieval:

The RAG tool converts the query into a vector, queries the vector store, and retrieves relevant documents (e.g., articles on AI development).
Retrieved data is pre-processed and sent to the LlmAgent as part of an augmented prompt.

#### MCP Tool Access:

The LlmAgent, acting as an MCP client, connects to an MCP server and invokes tools (e.g., YouTube Search for AI tutorials).
Tool outputs (e.g., video metadata) are returned to the LlmAgent.

#### LLM Response Generation:

The LLM processes the augmented prompt (query + RAG data + MCP outputs) to generate a coherent response.
The response integrates retrieved data and tool results for accuracy and relevance.

Response Delivery:

ADK delivers the LLM-generated response to the user, often with citations or links to sources.

#### Example Use Case

Query: “How to build an AI?”

- ADK: LlmAgent interprets the query and invokes RAG and MCP tools.
- RAG: Retrieves articles on AI development from a knowledge base.
- MCP: Fetches YouTube tutorial metadata via youtube_search.
- LLM: Generates a response: “To build an AI, follow these steps… [citing RAG data and YouTube links].”

Response: Delivered to the user with references.

#### Benefits

- Modularity: ADK’s agent-based architecture supports flexible workflows.
- Extensibility: Integrates with various LLMs, RAG systems, and MCP tools.
- Accuracy: RAG and MCP provide fresh, external data, overcoming LLM limitations.
- Scalability: Deployable on Google Cloud or other platforms for production use.
